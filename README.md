## DESCRIPTION
This is my solution to the code challenge. There were three challenges all of which I shall explain a brief summary of the process I used to solve them.

## PROJECT SETUP
****
# Requirements
1. Javascript
2. A text editor
****
# Student Grade Generator
Create a js file in your text editor and in it define grade using let variable.Describe a function grade generator that takes a parameter. As an arguement use a condition to satisfy the grades given returning the letter that describes the grade. Finally call you function and console.log it to ensure that it is working. 

# Speed Detector
Create a js file in your text editor and in it define speed using the let variable as it can be later recalled. Define points using a variable which equals a number that rounds down the value of the speed when it is subtracted by 70 then divided by 5.
Describe a function speed detector that has an if condition as the arguement where if the points is less than or equal to zero it returns "Ok.". If demerit points is less than or equal to 12 return the points. If the points exceed 12 then return "License suspended". 
Console.log the function to ensure it is working.

# Net Salary Calculator
Create a js file in your text editor and in it define gross salary, contribution benefit, disability exemption, deduction which is the difference of contribution benefit and disability exemption, taxable pay which is gross salary subtract deductions, total relief which is an addition of insurance relief and personal relief. 
Describe a function gross tax and use if condition returning the gross tax after the percentage has been calculated from taxable pay. Call the function.
Define payee which is gross tax subtract relief.
Describe a function net salary calculator that takes an if condition. If payee is less than or equal to zero return the gross salary if not return the net salary which is gross salary subtract payee.
Console.log the function to ensure it works.
